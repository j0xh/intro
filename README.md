South African IT and cybersecurity student focused on building practical tools for system administration, security monitoring, and network administration.

I enjoy working close to the operating system layer and building small, reliable utilities that help with diagnostics, monitoring, and troubleshooting. My goal is to develop strong fundamentals in Linux, networking, and Windows internals while producing tools that are useful in real environments.

A long term goal of mine is to obtain a well rounded understanding in exploitation on kernel level and it's development with x64 Assembly.
